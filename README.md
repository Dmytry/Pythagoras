# Pythagoras and Marionette printer kinematics

Very early version, work in progress; no instructions or BOM yet. I'll write something up in the coming weeks when the design becomes more stable.

I recommend Marionette over Pythagoras. I will likely rebuild Pythagoras with linkage-driven counter tensioner actuation, to reduce space requirements behind the mechanism. 

While I hadn't yet gotten Marionette to print, it has been a lot easier to build and design once the initial obstacle of coming up with the kinematic was overcome.
